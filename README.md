A simple app experimenting with JQTouch and Raphael JS on a Rails 3 platform. Also thrown in the mix is some poking at Jo (joapp.com) and Sencha.

- Rails 3
- JQuery
- JQTouch

## TODO:

- Add the map of the parking lot
- Settings/about page (change vehicle icon, developer info, etc)
- Offline mode (cache manifest)
